# Hi there, I'm Jonathan Ung 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a passionate software developer with a keen interest in AI, Data Science, and Computer Vision. For more information about me, check out my website: [jonathanung.ca](https://jonathanung.ca)

*Sometimes my GitHub will have times of inactivity. I am usually somewhat active to contributing to the [SFU Robot Soccer codebase on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sfurs/software), and my activity for that can [be found here](https://gitlab.com/jonathan.keith.ung).
